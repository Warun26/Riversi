Riversi
=======
The project contains an intelligent problem solving agent that employs search algorithms to play a game of Riversi

The agent runs in 4 modes.
Mode 1 to 3 is used for debugging purposes. 
If input option is 1 then the agent runs a greedy search to find the best move.
If the input option is 2 then the agent runs minimax algorithm. 
If the input option is 3 then the agent runs alpha beta pruning.
Options 2 and 3 logs the moves considered and helps in debugging.
If the input option is 4 then the agent enters a competition mode where it uses a few admissible heuristics to figure out the next optimal move while playing the game.
